Energy Theft 

Energy theft occurs when the smart meters at the consumer end report less consumption than the amount actually consumed, either due to intentional tampering or defective meters. 

1. For how to consider technical losses (distribution and transmission losses) see this paper - Electricity theft detection using smart meter data. 
2. TLs can also be a function of external enviromental factors such as temperature. 
3. Is it possible for the machines to be intentionally wrongly calibrated by the UPs to report more than the actual consumption (overcharging)? I suspect broadband providers do this. 
4. In MLR model authors have set bias to 0
5. Study about significance tests
6. See the method used by Yip et al. to catch variable energy theft - thy hav addd an xtra coeff to represent theft in on-peak hours seperately. (this seems like crude approach that can easily be fooled by using a complex meter cheating algo (e.g. cheat more when some extra compute power is required (not acc. to any particular schedule))))
