Anomaly Detection
 
1. HJC information criterion to obtain optimum lag order
2. #Quantile regression using Pinball loss to measure uncertainty of the forecast
3. #Evaluate using - PICP, PINAW, number of anomalies using QR vs using AutoEncoders vs using statistical methods

4. #Grading of quantile intervals & comparison with Z-score
4.5 #autoencoders (quantiles to AE?)
5. More data analysis (increase dims? consider sep dim to pass values for same day of prev week?)
6. Code NBEATS to understand how it works (also upgrade to tf2)
7. Read HTM paper
8. Read time series outliers chapter of Charu Aggarwal 
9. Read "What my deep model doesn't know blog"
